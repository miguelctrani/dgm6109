            <h3>Why This is One of My Best Scatterplots</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization is one of my best because it uses <strong>Array.sort()</strong> 
                to transform my scattered study sessions into a clear chronological narrative. By 
                sorting the data by date from oldest (Oct 15) to newest (Nov 5), the visualization 
                tells the complete story of my three-week coding journey—something that would be 
                impossible to see in unsorted data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sort reveals a dramatic progression: I started on October 15-22 with high 
                frustration (red circles) and low output (2-3 problems solved), struggled through 
                a transition period in late October as I learned new concepts, then experienced a 
                major breakthrough in early November. By November 3-5, I was consistently solving 
                8 problems per session with minimal frustration (green circles) and high confidence 
                (large circles).
            </p>
            <p>
                The dashed line connecting the points makes the trend unmistakable: my problem-solving 
                ability improved steadily over time. But the most valuable insight comes from watching 
                the circles change from red to green (decreasing frustration) while simultaneously 
                growing larger (increasing confidence). This shows that my improvement wasn't just 
                about memorizing syntax—I was genuinely becoming more comfortable with coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chronological ordering was essential for answering my research question: 
                <em>"How did I improve over time?"</em> Without the sort, these would just be scattered 
                data points. With the sort, they become a clear narrative of learning, struggle, 
                breakthrough, and mastery. The sort() method wasn't just a requirement—it was the 
                key to transforming data into a meaningful story.
