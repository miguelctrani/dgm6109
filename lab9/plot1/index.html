            <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As study time increases, problems solved increases 
            (filtered to show only successful sessions where I solved 5+ problems and actually studied).

            <h3>Why This is One of My Best Scatterplots</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization represents one of my best scatterplots because it uses 
                <strong>Array.filter()</strong> strategically to isolate only my most successful 
                study sessions. By filtering for sessions where <code>studyTime > 0</code> AND 
                <code>problemsSolved >= 5</code>, I eliminated two types of noise: days I didn't 
                study at all, and days where I was just learning concepts without solving problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The filter revealed a powerful pattern: all 7 of my breakthrough sessions (solving 
                5+ problems) occurred between October 20 and November 5, 2025. What's remarkable is 
                that these successful sessions show a clear correlation between high confidence 
                (larger circles) and low frustration (green colors). The filter helped me discover 
                that my best work happened when I was calm and confident, not when I was grinding 
                through frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most interesting insight: study time alone doesn't predict success. I had sessions 
                with 120 minutes (Oct 18) that only produced 4 problems solved, while sessions with 
                30-50 minutes in November produced 8 problems solved. The key difference? My mental 
                state, shown through the confidence and frustration indicators.
            </p>
            <p>
                This filtered view was genuinely useful—not just a requirement. It transformed my 
                raw data into actionable insight: <em>quality study sessions with the right mindset 
                matter more than simply logging hours.</em>
