            <h3>Understanding the Visualization</h3>
            
            <p>
                This visualization challenges the common assumption that "time heals all wounds" by examining 
                whether frustration decreases due to the passage of time or due to actual practice. The X-axis 
                shows the number of problems solved per session (a measure of active practice), while the Y-axis 
                displays my self-reported frustration level on a scale of 0-5. The data is sorted chronologically 
                using Array.sort() so that the connecting line shows my journey through time, allowing us to see 
                whether time or practice drives the emotional change.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Additional Visual Encodings:</strong> Circle size represents confidence level (0-5 scale), 
                while circle color uses a red-to-green gradient that reinforces the frustration measurement. The 
                chronological connecting line is crucial—it shows that early sessions (represented by points on 
                the left with high frustration) occurred first, while later sessions (points on the right with 
                low frustration) occurred after I had accumulated more practice solving problems.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Observations from the Data</h3>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Observation 1 - Time Alone Doesn't Reduce Frustration:</strong> The most striking pattern 
                appears in the left portion of the chart where several data points show frustration at level 3-5 
                even though multiple days had passed since I started learning. Sessions on October 17, 20, and 22 
                all show frustration at level 4-5, despite being spread across an entire week. These points cluster 
                at 2-5 problems solved, indicating that low practice output maintained high frustration regardless 
                of how many days elapsed. If time were the key factor, we would expect frustration to decrease 
                steadily across these dates—but it doesn't.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Observation 2 - The Practice Threshold Effect:</strong> A clear pattern emerges when 
                examining the relationship between problems solved and frustration. All sessions where I solved 
                0-5 problems show frustration ranging from 1-5 (highly variable), but every single session where 
                I solved 8 problems shows frustration at exactly level 1 (consistently low). This suggests a 
                threshold effect: once practice reaches a certain level of productivity (8 problems per session), 
                frustration becomes minimal and stable. The sessions with 0 problems solved (October 24 and 30) 
                show moderate frustration (level 2-3) despite occurring late in my learning timeline, further 
                proving that time alone doesn't guarantee reduced frustration—actual problem-solving practice does.
            </p>
            
           
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            
            <p>
                The visualization definitively answers the research question: practice, not time, is the key to 
                reducing frustration in learning to code. Multiple pieces of evidence support this conclusion. 
                First, frustration remained high (level 4-5) across multiple sessions in the first week despite 
                time passing, because practice output remained low (2-5 problems). Second, frustration dropped 
                to its lowest point (level 1) only when practice reached its highest level (8 problems solved), 
                creating a clear correlation between practice quantity and emotional state. Third, the two 
                concept-learning sessions (0 problems solved) occurring late in the timeline still showed moderate 
                frustration, proving that the mere passage of time doesn't guarantee reduced frustration.
